To perform experiments, run the 'pebm.py' file. Settings can be specified in the 'input.py' file. Unless specified otherwise, the file located in the 'results/test' folder will be used.

To run multiple experiments with different settings, use the 'master.py' file. A new folder will be created for each setting, if it does not exist already. The 'input.py' file from the 'results' folder will be used.

To run experiments on the Navier-Stokes data, first download the 'cylinder_nektar_wake.mat' file from the github page https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs, and save it in the folder 'data'.
